Version 1 was used to obtain most results.

Version 1.1 allowed to stop gene flow at a given generation, to tell apart the effects of gene flow and selection on populations with different frequencies of the karyotypes.

Version 1.1.1 attempted to correct population fitness plotting, so that populations where no males have a Y have a fitness of 1. 

Version 1.2 changed the plotting of the fusion and Y clines, (totalY, ChrCline tick boxes) so that they are relative to the rest of the population and not absolute. Best run at a greater generation interval (output every 500) so that the result can be quickly appreciated from the text files without any Excel involvement, which is the slowest step.

Version 1.3 changed the female chr cline plotting to plot only populations where the fusion is above 50%. This allows easy visual inspection of the time required for the fusion to spread or retreat and was used to generate the table on speed of fusion spread. Can find (on00' 0.) in the generated text file to find the first generation where the fusion has spread by 1 Km.
